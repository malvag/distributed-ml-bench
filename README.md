# Distributed ML Systems

Recently, I was involved in a classification-based ML project where we developed a distributed scalable ML service. I wanted to build it again on a simpler dataset to deepen my understanding.

## Introduction

Why distributed systems? Distributing machine learning systems allows developers to handle massive datasets across multiple clusters, take advantage of automation tools, and benefit from hardware accelerations. This repo includes code and references to implement a scalable and reliable machine learning system.

I'm automating machine learning tasks with Kubernetes, Argo Workflows, Kubeflow, and TensorFlow. I aim to construct machine learning pipelines with data ingestion, distributed training, model serving, managing, and monitoring these workloads. I'm building an image classification end-to-end machine learning system.

## Setup

I'm using a Mac and Homebrew to install the tools. We will install Tensorflow, Docker, kubectl, and k3d, a lightweight wrapper for k3s, which is lightweight Kubernetes.

[1] We will be using [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org) for data processing, model building and evaluation
```bash
pip install tensorflow
```

[2] [Docker](https://docker-curriculum.com/#setting-up-your-computer) to create single- or multi-node [k3s](https://k3s.io) clusters

[3] kubectl is a CLI for Kubernetes
```bash
brew install kubectl
```

[4] We will use Kubernetes as our core distributed infrastructure. In fact, we will use [k3d](https://k3d.io/v5.5.2/) which is a lightweight wrapper to run k3s (Rancher Labâ€™s minimal Kubernetes distribution) in docker. It's great for local Kubernetes development.

To install k3d:

```bash
wget -q -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/k3d-io/k3d/main/install.sh | TAG=v5.0.0 bash
k3d cluster create dist-ml --image rancher/k3s:v1.25.3-k3s1
kubectl get nodes
```

[5] [kubectx](https://github.com/ahmetb/kubectx/) and kubens to easily switch contexts and namespaces

```bash
brew install kubectx
```

[6] We will use [Kubeflow](https://www.kubeflow.org) to submit jobs to the Kubernetes cluster. Install Kubeflow training operator to run distributed TensorFlow jobs on Kubernetes.

![Kubeflow UI](https://github.com/aniket-mish/distributed-ml-system/assets/71699313/aa731d8d-93cf-4089-a7a4-4a9b0f47e4eb "https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/started/architecture/")

[7] We will also use [Argo workflows](https://argoproj.github.io/workflows) to construct and submit end-to-end machine learning workflows. Install Argo workflows.


Next, we create a namespace. The namespaces provide a mechanism for isolating groups of resources within a single cluster.

To create a namespace

```bash
kubectl create namespace kubeflow
```

Next, switch to kubeflow

```bash
kubens kubeflow
```

I'm getting an error `couldn't get resource list for metrics.k8s.io/v1beta1: the server is currently unable to handle the request`. After looking on I understood that I need to edit the metrics server deployment yaml and add `hostNetwork: true` after `dnsPolicy`. It started working again.

Now, we install the dependencies kubeflow training operator.

```bash
# https://github.com/kubeflow/training-operator#stable-release
kubectl apply -k "github.com/kubeflow/training-operator/manifests/overlays/standalone?ref=v1.5.0"
```

## Some Basics

For example, if you want to create a kubernetes pod, then create a hello-world.yaml as below.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: whalesay
spec:
  containers:
  - name: whalesay
    image: docker/whalesay:latest
    command: [cowsay]
    args: ["hello world"]
```

Next, submit the job to our cluster

```bash
kubectl create -f hello-world.yaml
```

We can see the statuses

```bash
kubectl get pods
```

We can see what is being printed out in the container

```bash
kubectl logs whalesay
```

If you want to get the details of a single pod with the raw YAML, then enter the following command

```bash
kubectl get pod whalesay -o yaml
```

You can get the JSON or any other format as well.

## System Architecture

<img width="1143" alt="Screenshot 2023-06-30 at 12 50 13 PM" src="https://github.com/aniket-mish/distributed-ml-system/assets/71699313/18bb1322-1970-4ef4-a3a6-f7d345623ee0">

## Data Ingestion

We will use the Fashion MNIST dataset which contains 70,000 grayscale images in 10 categories. The images show individual articles of clothing at low resolution (28 by 28 pixels), as seen here:

![image](https://github.com/aniket-mish/distributed-ml-system/assets/71699313/9356978d-f3ab-4404-b35b-d5e50b3c82cb)

Here, 60,000 images are used to train the network and 10,000 images are used to evaluate how accurately the network learned to classify images.

### Single-node Data Pipeline

The `tf.data` API enables you to build complex input pipelines from simple, reusable pieces. It's very efficient. It makes it possible to handle large amounts of data, read from different data formats, and perform complex transformations.

Load the fashion-mnist dataset into a `tf.data.Dataset` object and do some preprocessing. We normalize the image pixel values from the [0, 255] range to the [0, 1] range. We are keeping an in-memory cache to improve performance. We also shuffle the training data.

```python
import tensorflow_datasets as tfds
import tensorflow as tf

def mnist_dataset():
    BUFFER_SIZE = 10000
    def scale(image, label):
        image = tf.cast(image, tf.float32)
        image /= 255
        return image, label
    datasets, info = tfds.load(name='mnist', with_info=True, as_supervised=True)
    mnist_train = datasets['train']
    return mnist_train.map(scale).cache().shuffle(BUFFER_SIZE)
```

We have used the tensorflow_datasets module which contains a collection of datasets ready to use. This gives us a shuffled dataset where each element consists of images and labels.

### Distributed Data Pipeline

We can consume our dataset in a distributed fashion as well and to do that we can use the same function we created before with some tweaks. When training a model with multiple GPUs, you can use the extra computing power effectively by increasing the batch size. In general, use the largest batch size that fits the GPU memory.

```python
strategy = tf.distribute.MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy()
BATCH_SIZE_PER_REPLICA = 64
BATCH_SIZE = BATCH_SIZE_PER_REPLICA * strategy.num_replicas_in_sync
```

The `num_replicas_in_sync` equals the number of devices that are used in the [all-reduce]() operation. We have used the `tf.distribute.MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy` API and with the help of this strategy, a Keras model that was designed to run on a single worker can seamlessly work on multiple workers with minimal code changes.

We have also enabled automatic data sharding across workers by setting `tf.data.experimental.AutoShardPolicy` to `AutoShardPolicy.DATA`. This setting is needed to ensure convergence and performance. Sharding means handing each worker a subset of the entire dataset. You can read more about it [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/data/experimental/DistributeOptions).

```python
with strategy.scope():
    dataset = mnist_dataset().batch(BATCH_SIZE).repeat()
    options = tf.data.Options()
    options.experimental_distribute.auto_shard_policy = tf.data.experimental.AutoShardPolicy.DATA
    dataset = dataset.with_options(options)
    model = build_and_compile_cnn_model()

model.fit(dataset, epochs=3, steps_per_epoch=70)
```

## Model Training

Now we have created a data ingestion component for distributed ingestion and have enabled the sharding as well.

```python
def build_and_compile_cnn_model():
  print("Training CNN model")
  model = tf.keras.Sequential([
      tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, 3, activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
      tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D(),
      tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
      tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
      tf.keras.layers.Dense(10)
    ])

  model.compile(loss=tf.keras.losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy(from_logits=True),
                optimizer=tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.001),
                metrics=['accuracy'])
  return model
```

Next, we created a model and instantiated the optimizer. We are using accuracy to evaluate the model and sparse categorical cross entropy as the loss function.

Now we can train the model. We are also defining callbacks that will be executed during model training.

1. `tf.keras.callbacks.ModelCheckpoint` saves the model at a certain frequency, such as after every epoch

```python
checkpoint_dir = './training_checkpoints'
checkpoint_prefix = os.path.join(checkpoint_dir, "ckpt_{epoch}")
```
Here we are defining the checkpoint directory to store the checkpoints and  the name of the checkpoint files.

2. `tf.keras.callbacks.TensorBoard` writes a log for TensorBoard, which allows you to visualize the graphs
3. `tf.keras.callbacks.LearningRateScheduler` schedules the learning rate to change after, for example, every epoch/batch

```python
def decay(epoch):
  if epoch < 3:
    return 1e-3
  elif epoch >= 3 and epoch < 7:
    return 1e-4
  else:
    return 1e-5
```

4. PrintLR prints the learning rate at the end of each epoch

```python
class PrintLR(tf.keras.callbacks.Callback):
  def on_epoch_end(self, epoch, logs=None):
    print('\nLearning rate for epoch {} is {}'.format(        epoch + 1, model.optimizer.lr.numpy()))
```

We put together all the callbacks.

```python
callbacks = [
    tf.keras.callbacks.TensorBoard(log_dir='./logs'),
    tf.keras.callbacks.ModelCheckpoint(filepath=checkpoint_prefix,
                                       save_weights_only=True),
    tf.keras.callbacks.LearningRateScheduler(decay),
    PrintLR()
]
```

Next, we can train the model

```python
single_worker_model = build_and_compile_cnn_model()
single_worker_model.fit(dataset, epochs=3, steps_per_epoch=70, callbacks=callbacks)
```

After training, we get an accuracy of 94% on the training data.

### Distributed Model Training

Next, we can insert the distributed training logic so that we can train the model on multiple workers. We are using the MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy with Keras.

In general, there are two common ways to do [distributed training with data parallelism](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/distribute/multi_worker_with_keras):
1. Synchronous training, where the steps of training are synced across the workers and replicas. Here, all workers train over different slices of input data in sync, and aggregating gradients at each step.
2. Asynchronous training, where the training steps are not strictly synced. Here, all workers are independently training over the input data and updating variables asynchronously. For instance, [parameter server training](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/distribute/parameter_server_training).

We are using the MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy which implements synchronous distributed training across multiple workers, each with potentially multiple GPUs. It replicates all variables and computations to each local device and uses distributed collective implementation (e.g. all-reduce) so that multiple workers can work together.

Once we define our distributed training strategy, we initiate our distributed input data pipeline and the model inside the strategy scope.

### Model saving and loading

To save the model using `model.save`, the saving destinations need to be different for each worker.

- For non-chief workers, save the model to a temporary directory
- For the chief, save the model to the provided directory
The temporary directories of the workers need to be unique to prevent errors. The model saved in all the directories is identical, and only the model saved by the chief should be referenced for restoring or serving.

We will not save the model to temporary directories as it will waste our computing resources and memory. We will determine which worker is the chief and save its model only.
We can determine if the worker is the chief or not using the environment variable `TF_CONFIG`. Here's an example configuration:

```python
tf_config = {
    'cluster': {
        'worker': ['localhost:12345', 'localhost:23456']
    },
    'task': {'type': 'worker', 'index': 0}
}
```
The `_is_chief` is a utility function that inspects the cluster spec and current task type and returns True if the worker is the chief and False otherwise.

```python
def _is_chief():
  return TASK_INDEX == 0

tf_config = json.loads(os.environ.get('TF_CONFIG') or '{}')
TASK_INDEX = tf_config['task']['index']

if _is_chief():
    model_path = args.saved_model_dir
else:
    model_path = args.saved_model_dir + '/worker_tmp_' + str(TASK_INDEX)

multi_worker_model.save(model_path)
```

### Containerization

We put everything we wrote till now into a Python script called `multi-worker-distributed-training.py`. Now we can dockerize it to train the model in the Kubernetes cluster.

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.9
RUN pip install tensorflow==2.12.0 tensorflow_datasets==4.9.2
COPY multi-worker-distributed-training.py /
```

We then build the image from the dockerfile.

```bash
docker build -f Dockerfile -t kubeflow/multi-worker-strategy:v0.1 .
```

<img width="865" alt="image" src="https://github.com/aniket-mish/distributed-ml-system/assets/71699313/f4a6fbdb-0704-4f61-963d-b876874a2183">

Next, import the above image to the k3d cluster as it cannot access the image registry.

```bash
k3d image import kubeflow/multi-worker-strategy:v0.1 --cluster dist-ml
```

<img width="861" alt="image" src="https://github.com/aniket-mish/distributed-ml-system/assets/71699313/c96adade-741e-4bd6-a958-49007917a844">

Now when the pods are completed/failed, all files in the pods are recycled by the Kubernetes garbage collection. So all the model checkpoints are lost and we don't have a model for serving. To avoid this we use PersistentVolume(PV) and PersistentVolumeClaim(PVC).

A **_PersistentVolume_** (PV) is a piece of storage in the cluster that has been provisioned by an administrator or dynamically provisioned. It is a resource in the cluster just like a node is a cluster resource. PVs are volume plugins like Volumes but have a lifecycle independent of any individual Pod that uses the PV. This means that PV will persist and live even when the pods are deleted.

A **_PersistentVolumeClaim_** (PVC) is a request for storage by a user. It is similar to a Pod. Pods consume node resources and PVCs consume PV resources. Pods can request specific levels of resources (CPU and Memory). Claims can request specific size and access modes (e.g., they can be mounted ReadWriteOnce, ReadOnlyMany, or ReadWriteMany).

We can create a PVC to submit a request for storage that will be used in worker pods to store the trained model. Here we are requesting 1GB storage with ReadWriteOnce mode.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: volume
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  volumeMode: Filesystem
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi
```

Next, we create the PVC.

```bash
kubectl create -f multi-worker-pvc.yaml
```

Next, we will define a TFJob specification with the image we built before that contains the distributed training script.

```yaml
apiVersion: kubeflow.org/v1
kind: TFJob
metadata:
  name: multi-worker-training
spec:
  runPolicy:
    cleanPodPolicy: None
  tfReplicaSpecs:
    Worker:
      replicas: 2
      restartPolicy: Never
      template:
        spec:
          containers:
            - name: tensorflow
              image: kubeflow/multi-worker-strategy:v0.1
              imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
              command: ["python", "/multi-worker-distributed-training.py", "--saved_model_dir", "/trained_model/saved_model_versions/2/", "--checkpoint_dir", "/trained_model/checkpoint"]
              volumeMounts:
                - mountPath: /trained_model
                  name: training
              resources:
                limits:
                  cpu: 500m
          volumes:
            - name: training
              persistentVolumeClaim:
                claimName: volume
```

We pass the arguments (`saved_model_dir`, `checkpoint_dir`) to the container. The `volumes` field specifies the persistent volume claim and `volumeMounts` field specifies what folder to mount the files. The `CleanPodPolicy` in the TFJob spec controls the deletion of pods when a job terminates. The `restartPolicy` determines whether pods will be restarted when they exit.

Next, we submit this TFJob to our cluster and start our distributed model training.

```bash
kubectl create -f multi-worker-tfjob.yaml
```

Let's start the pods and train our distributed model. We can see the logs from the pods below.

```bash
kubectl logs multi-worker-training-worker-0
```

We can also edit code and resubmit the job.

```bash
kubectl delete tfjob --all; docker build -f Dockerfile -t kubeflow/multi-worker-strategy:v0.1 .; k3d image import kubeflow/multi-worker-strategy:v0.1 --cluster distml; kubectl create -f multi-worker-tfjob.yaml
```

## Model Selection

We've implemented the distributed model training component. In production, we might need to train different models and pick the top performer for model serving. Let's create two more models to understand this concept.

One model I'mm trying is the CNN model with batch norm layer.

```python
def build_and_compile_cnn_model_with_batch_norm():
  print("Training CNN model with batch normalization")
  model = models.Sequential()
  model.add(layers.Input(shape=(28, 28, 1), name='image_bytes'))
  model.add(layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu'))
  model.add(layers.BatchNormalization())
  model.add(layers.Activation('sigmoid'))
  model.add(layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)))
  model.add(layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'))
  model.add(layers.BatchNormalization())
  model.add(layers.Activation('sigmoid'))
  model.add(layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)))
  model.add(layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'))
  model.add(layers.Flatten())
  model.add(layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'))
  model.add(layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax'))

  model.summary()

  model.compile(optimizer='adam',
                loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
                metrics=['accuracy'])

  return model
```

The other model I'm trying is the CNN model with dropout.

```python
def build_and_compile_cnn_model_with_dropout():
  print("Training CNN model with dropout")
  model = models.Sequential()
  model.add(layers.Input(shape=(28, 28, 1), name='image_bytes'))
  model.add(layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu'))
  model.add(layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)))
  model.add(layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'))
  model.add(layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)))
  model.add(layers.Dropout(0.5))
  model.add(layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'))
  model.add(layers.Flatten())
  model.add(layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'))
  model.add(layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax'))

  model.summary()

  model.compile(optimizer='adam',
                loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
                metrics=['accuracy'])

  return model
```

We train these models by submitting three different TFJobs with an argument `--model_type`.

Next, we load the testing data and the trained model to evaluate its performance. The model with the highest accuracy score can be moved to a different folder and used for model serving.

```python
def scale(image, label):
  image = tf.cast(image, tf.float32)
  image /= 255
  return image, label

best_model_path = ""
best_accuracy = 0

for i in range(3):
  model_path = "trained_models/saved_model_versions/" + str(i)
  model = tf.keras.models.load_model(model_path)

  datasets, info = tfds.load(name='mnist', with_info=True, as_supervised=True)
  mnist_test = datasets['test']
  ds = mnist_test.map(scale).cache().shuffle(BUFFER_SIZE).batch(64)
  loss, accuracy = model.evaluate(ds)

  if accuracy > best_accuracy:
    best_accuracy = accuracy
    best_model_path = model_path

dst = "trained_model/saved_model_versions/3"
shutil.copytree(best_model_path, dst)
```

We add this script to the Dockerfile, rebuild the image, and create a pod that runs the script for model selection.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: model-selection
spec:
  containers:
  - name: predict
    image: kubeflow/multi-worker-strategy:v0.1
    command: ["python", "/model-selection.py"]
    volumeMounts:
    - name: model
      mountPath: /trained_model
  volumes:
  - name: model
    persistentVolumeClaim:
      claimName: strategy-volume
```

## Model Serving

We implemented distributed training and model selection. Now we implement the model serving component. Here we take the trained model from `trained_model/saved_model_versions/3`. The model serving should be very performant.

### Single server model inference

```python
model_path = "trained_models/saved_model_versions/3"
model = tf.keras.models.load_model(model_path)
datasets, info = tfds.load(name='mnist', with_info=True, as_supervised=True)
mnist_test = datasets['test']
ds = mnist_test.map(scale).cache().shuffle(BUFFER_SIZE).batch(64)
loss, accuracy = model.predict(ds)
```

We can also use [TFServing](https://keras.io/examples/keras_recipes/tf_serving/) to expose our model as an endpoint service. You can check the installation process [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/serving/setup).

```bash
# Environment variable with the path to the model
os.environ["MODEL_PATH"] = f"{model_path}"

nohup tensorflow_model_server \
  --port=8500 \
  --rest_api_port=8501 \
  --model_name=model \
  --model_base_path=$MODEL_PATH
```

_Nohup, short for no hang up is a command in Linux systems that keeps processes running even after exiting the shell or terminal._

The method mentioned above works great if we're only experimenting locally. There are more efficient ways for distributed model serving.

TensorFlow models contain a signature definition that defines the signature of a computation supported in a TensorFlow graph. SignatureDefs aims to provide generic support to identify the inputs and outputs of a function. We can modify this input layer with a preprocessing function so that clients can use base64 encoded images, which is a standard way of sending images through RESTFUL APIs. To do that, weâ€™ll save a model with new serving signatures. The new signatures use Python functions to handle preprocessing the image from a JPEG to a Tensor. [Refer](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/developers-practitioners/add-preprocessing-functions-tensorflow-models-and-deploy-vertex-ai)

```python
def _preprocess(bytes_inputs):
    decoded = tf.io.decode_jpeg(bytes_inputs, channels=1)
    resized = tf.image.resize(decoded, size=(28, 28))
    return tf.cast(resized, dtype=tf.uint8)

def _get_serve_image_fn(model):
    @tf.function(input_signature=[tf.TensorSpec([None], tf.string)])
    def serve_image_fn(bytes_inputs):
        decoded_images = tf.map_fn(_preprocess, bytes_inputs, dtype=tf.uint8)
        return model(decoded_images)
    return serve_image_fn

signatures = {
    "serving_default": _get_serve_image_fn(model).get_concrete_function(
        tf.TensorSpec(shape=[None], dtype=tf.string)
    )
}

tf.saved_model.save(multi_worker_model, model_path, signatures=signatures)
```

Now we have updated the training script, we should rebuild the image and re-train the model.

Next, we will use KServe for inference service. [KServe](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/external-add-ons/kserve/kserve/) enables serverless inferencing on Kubernetes and provides performant, high-abstraction interfaces for common machine learning (ML) frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, etc. [Refer](https://kserve.github.io/website/0.11/modelserving/v1beta1/tensorflow/).

We create an [InferenceService](https://kserve.github.io/website/0.11/get_started/first_isvc/#run-your-first-inferenceservice) yaml, which specifies the framework tensorflow and storageUri that is pointed to a saved tensorflow model.

```yaml
apiVersion: "serving.kserve.io/v1beta1"
kind: "InferenceService"
metadata:
  name: "tf-mnist"
spec:
  predictor:
    model:
      modelFormat:
        name: tensorflow
      storageUri: "pvc://strategy-volume/saved_model_versions"
```

Install KServe

```bash
curl -s "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kserve/kserve/release-0.11/hack/quick_install.sh" | bash
```

Next, apply the inference-service.yaml to create the InferenceService. By default, it exposes an HTTP/REST endpoint.

```bash
kubectl apply -f inference-service.yaml
```

Wait for the InferenceService to be in a ready state.

```bash
kubectl get isvc tf-mnist
```

Next, we run the prediction. But first, we need to determine and set the INGRESS_HOST and INGRESS_PORT. An ingress gateway is like an API gateway that load-balances requests. To test it locally we have to do `Port Forward`.

```bash
INGRESS_GATEWAY_SERVICE=$(kubectl get svc --namespace istio-system --selector="app=istio-ingressgateway" --output jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}')
kubectl port-forward --namespace istio-system svc/${INGRESS_GATEWAY_SERVICE} 8080:80
```

Then do the following

```bash
export INGRESS_HOST=localhost
export INGRESS_PORT=8080
```

We can send a sample request to our inference service. We can curl.

```bash
SERVICE_HOSTNAME=$(kubectl get inferenceservice tf-mnist -n kubeflow -o jsonpath='{.status.url}' | cut -d "/" -f 3)
curl -v -H "Host: ${SERVICE_HOSTNAME}" http://${INGRESS_HOST}:${INGRESS_PORT}/v1/models/tf-mnist:predict -d @./mnist-input.json
```

or we use the requests library.

```python
response = requests.post("http://${INGRESS_HOST}:${INGRESS_PORT}/v1/models/tf-mnist:predict", json=mnist-input.json, headers={"Host": "tf-mnist.kubeflow.example.com"})
```

# [TODO]

## Replicated model servers inference

Next, I want to have multiple model servers to handle large amounts of traffic. KServe can autoscale based on the requests.

# [TODO]
kserve autoscale

```yaml
apiVersion: "serving.kserve.io/v1beta1"
kind: "InferenceService"
metadata:
  name: "tf-mnist"
  annotations:
    autoscaling.knative.dev/target: "1"
spec:
  predictor:
    containerConcurrency: 1
    model:
      modelFormat:
        name: tensorflow
      storageUri: "pvc://strategy-volume/saved_model_versions"
```

Next, I install [Hey](https://github.com/rakyll/hey), a tiny program that sends some load to a web application.

```bash
# https://github.com/rakyll/hey
brew install hey
kubectl create -f inference-service.yaml

hey -z 30s -q 5 -m POST -host ${SERVICE_HOSTNAME} -D mnist-input.json http://${INGRESS_HOST}:${INGRESS_PORT}/v1/models/tf-mnist:predict
```

# [TODO]
load testing with hey

## End-to-end Workflow

# [TODO]
why? how?

I'm creating an end-to-end workflow with 4 steps:
1. Data Ingestion
2. Distributed Training
3. Model Selection
4. Model Serving

```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Workflow                  # new type of k8s spec
metadata:
  generateName: tfjob-wf-    # name of the workflow spec
spec:
  entrypoint: tfjob-wf          # invoke the tfjob template
  templates:
  - name: tfjob-wf
    # Instead of just running a container
    # This template has a sequence of steps
    steps:
    - - name: data-ingestion-step            # data-ingestion-step is run before the following steps
        template: data-ingestion
    - - name: distributed-training-step      # double dash => run after previous step
        template: distributed-training
    - - name: model-selection-step
        template: model-selection
    - - name: model-serving-step
        template: model-serving
podGC:
  strategy: OnPodSuccess
volumes:
- name: model
  persistentVolumeClaim:
    claimName: strategy-volume
```

# [TODO]
steps
podGC
OnPodSuccess
