# Distributed ML Systems

Distributing machine learning systems allow developers to handle extremely large datasets across multiple clusters, take advantage of automation tools, and benefit from hardware accelerations. This repo includes code and references to implement scalable and reliable machine learning system.

We are going to automate machine learning tasks with Kubernetes, Argo Workflows, Kubeflow and TensorFlow.

Our goal is to construct machine learning pipelines with data ingestion, distibuted training, model serving, managing and monitoring these workloads.
 
## Setup

I'm using a mac and brew to install the tools. We are going to install Tensorflow, Docker, kubectl, k3d which is a lightweight wrapper for k3s which is lightweight kubernetes.

[1] We will be using [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org) for data processing, model building and evaluation
- `pip install tensorflow`

[2] [Docker](https://docker-curriculum.com/#setting-up-your-computer) to create single- or multi-node [k3s](https://k3s.io) clusters

[3] kubectl is a CLI for Kubernetes
- `brew install kubectl`

[4] We will use Kubernetes as our core distributed infrastructure. Infact we will use [k3d](https://k3d.io/v5.5.2/) which is a lightweight wrapper to run k3s (Rancher Labâ€™s minimal Kubernetes distribution) in docker

To install k3d:
- `wget -q -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/k3d-io/k3d/main/install.sh | TAG=v5.0.0 bash`
- `k3d cluster create dist-ml`
- `kubectl get nodes`

[5] [kubectx](https://github.com/ahmetb/kubectx/) and kubens to easily switch contexts and namespaces
- `brew install kubectx`

[6] We will use [Kubeflow](https://www.kubeflow.org) to submit jobs to the Kubernetes cluster

[7] We wil also use [Argo workflows](https://argoproj.github.io/workflows) to construct and submit end to end machine learning workflows

For example if you want to create a kubernetes pod, then create a hello-world.yaml and then do `kubectl create -f hello-world.yaml` 

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: whalesay
spec:
  containers:
  - name: whalesay
    image: docker/whalesay:latest
    command: [cowsay]
    args: ["hello world"]
```

then `kubectl get pods`

to see what is being printed out in the container, you can do  `kubectl logs whalesay`

If you want to get the details of a single pod with the raw yaml, then do `kubectl get pod whalesay -o yaml`
You can get the JSON or any other format as well


## Introduction

We are building an image classification end-to-end machine learning system. 

### System Architecture

## Data Ingestion

We will use the Fashion MNIST dataset which contains 70,000 grayscale images in 10 categories. The images show individual articles of clothing at low resolution (28 by 28 pixels), as seen here:

Here, 60,000 images are used to train the network and 10,000 images to evaluate how accurately the network learned to classify images.
