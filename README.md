## Introduction

We are building an image classification end-to-end machine learning system.

### System Architecture

## Data Ingestion

We will use the Fashion MNIST dataset which contains 70,000 grayscale images in 10 categories. The images show individual articles of clothing at low resolution (28 by 28 pixels), as seen here:

Here, 60,000 images are used to train the network and 10,000 images to evaluate how accurately the network learned to classify images.
